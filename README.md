# Maritime Security Threat Detection
### Supervisor: Rory Hopcraft

This project will be aimed at the stakeholders in maritime security, for example shipping companies in order to ensure the security of maritime activities and detect current or emerging threats. It will use open-source data including AIS databases, geopolitical information and maritime traffic to monitor and report potential security risks. It will explore using machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and any threats in real time.

## üåü Features

-  **Live AIS Data Feed:** Displays real-time ship locations using **Leaflet.js** and WebSockets.
-  **Anomaly Detection:** Flags ships with unusual movement patterns.
-  **Search Functionality:** Quickly locate a vessel using its **Ship ID**.
-  **Interactive UI:** Hover over a ship to view **latitude, longitude, and Ship ID**.

## üìå How It Works

- **Ais Data Stream:** Ships are recieved via AISStream.io
- **Map Rendering:** Ships appear dynamically via Leaflet.js
- **Anomaly Detection:** The ML model - isolation forest - flags anomalies
- **User Interaction:**
  - Hover a ship to see details
  - Use the search bar to find vessels 

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Leaflet.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Websockets
- **Machine Learning:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
- **Data sources:**
    - AIS stream from AISStream.io
    - Historical AIS data from University of Plymouth
