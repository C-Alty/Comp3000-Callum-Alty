Maritime Security Threat Detection
Supervisor: Rory Hopcraft

This project will be aimed at the stakeholders in maritime security, for example shipping companies in order to ensure the security of maritime activities and detect current or emerging threats. It will use open-source data including AIS databases, geopolitical information and maritime traffic to monitor and report potential security risks. It will explore using machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and any threats in real time.
